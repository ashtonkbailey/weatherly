# Weatherly

This is a simple weather app that can display the current, 24hour, 7hour ., and 10day forecasts of a chosen location. This was our first attempt at consuming and displaying API data with React.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
